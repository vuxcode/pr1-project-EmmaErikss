The website is an online store focused on furniture and home decor. I want people to get a warm feeling through the soft colors, which are meant to emulate Nordic interior design and colors.

I think the project went well. I challenged myself by adding some parts that we haven't covered in the lessons, which was sometimes very difficult and sometimes went well.
but my overall feeling is that it has gone well. I have had a bit of difficulty keeping track of the exact time I have spent on the project, but I think I have spent more than the budget allowed. Much of the time went into trying to understand and learn the new parts. Some parts of the website still don't work, and if I had had more time, I could have gotten my drag and drop, shopping cart, etc. to work.
