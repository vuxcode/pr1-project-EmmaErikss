1. Problem: Hade some problem with getting the onclick function work on the filter button for product page. Didn't happen anything when i clicked the button. I realised after some reading that there was different ways to refer to a id and class (querySelector and getElementById). That solved the problem. 

2. I had some troubles with placing my items excatly how i want both with the christmas site and the product page. Therefore i needed to learn more about grid, then i found it easier to place the items in different positions even though they are in the same div.
